// Package cla defines two interfaces for Convergence Layer Adapters.
//
// The ConvergenceReceiver specifies a type which receives bundles and forwards
// those to an exposed channel.
//
// The ConvergenceSender specifies a type which sends bundles to a remote
// endpoint.
//
// An implemented convergence layer can be a ConvergenceReceiver,
// ConvergenceSender or even both. This depends on the convergence layer's
// specification and is an implementation matter.
//
// Furthermore, the ConvergenceProvider provides the ability to create new
// instances of Convergence objects.
//
// Those types are generalized by the Convergable interface.
//
// A centralized instance for CLA management offers the Manager, designed to
// work seamlessly with the types above.
